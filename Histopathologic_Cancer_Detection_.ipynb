    "# Histopathologic Cancer Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we work on the Kaggle challenge titled *Histopathologic Cancer Detection*. The goal is to identify the presence of metastatic tissue in small histopathologic image patches derived from larger digital pathology scans.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **binary image classification** problem:\n",
    "- `1`: Tumor present (metastatic cancer tissue in center region)\n",
    "- `0`: No tumor tissue in the center\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge has real-world implications: pathologists often scan large digital slides for regions of cancerous tissue, and automating this process can accelerate diagnosis and reduce human error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is derived from the **PatchCamelyon (PCam)** benchmark dataset, a popular and approachable dataset designed for evaluating metastasis detection models. This Kaggle version:\n",
    "- **Removes duplicates** that existed due to probabilistic sampling in the original PCam.\n",
    "- Maintains the same data split and label definition as PCam.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the authors of PCam:\n",
    "> \"[PCam] packs the clinically-relevant task of metastasis detection into a straight-forward binary image classification task, akin to CIFAR-10 and MNIST. Models can easily be trained on a single GPU in a couple hours, and achieve competitive scores in the Camelyon16 tasks of tumor detection and whole-slide image diagnosis. Furthermore, the balance between task-difficulty and tractability makes it a prime suspect for fundamental machine learning research on topics as active learning, model uncertainty, and explainability.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Details\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Image Size**: 96×96 RGB\n",
    "- **Training Images**: 220,025\n",
    "- **Label**: Binary (0 or 1)\n",
    "- **Focus**: Label depends only on the **center 32×32 region** — this region must contain at least **one pixel of tumor** for the image to be labeled as `1`. The surrounding border is included to support models that avoid zero-padding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "Submissions are evaluated using the **Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC ROC)** between predicted probabilities and true binary labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission Format\n",
    "\n",
    "For each `id` in the test set, your model should predict a **probability** that the center 32×32 region contains tumor tissue. The CSV submission should follow this format:\n",
    "\n",
